## **As Creative Director responsible for TD Bank’s presence in North America, I led the concept, design, engineering, and installation of a virtual forest at TD’s Union Square store in NYC to showcase TD’s unique green initiative.**

The bank itself was transformed, and we customized historic NYC viewfinders with video and audio to create a 3D walk thru the habitat TD protects everyday.

In 30 days, over 75,000 people stopped, and spent almost 3 minutes with these experiences, resulting in newfound interest in the TD brand, and setting the bar for how a bank should prove it’s gone green

# **American Electric Power, Energy Wall**

## **Working closely with American Electric Power, I joined the event team to concept, creative direct, design and engineer a pair of interactive experiences inside American Electric Power’s HQ in Columbus, OH.**

AEP wanted to communicate the innovative plants and highlight the communities they support, as well as tie in over 50 years of impact and innovation. A theater-sized interactive wall was designed to allow anyone to experience each plant through interactive walk throughs, pan through communities, and in some cases ride along with drones as they fly across a dam, depart from a wind turbine, or venture inside a nuclear power plant. A sea of kiosks were also strategically placed around the lobby to educate and inspire employees and guests to spark new conversations and explore how far AEP has come — and learn where they’re headed.

While only active for a few months, nearly every guest, client and 75% of the 17,000 AEP employees have interacted directly, and/or shared content for the wall.
